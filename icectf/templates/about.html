    <h5>IceCTF</h5>
    <p>IceCTF is a computer security contest targeted at anyone with an interest in computer science. The game consists of a series of challenges where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it a great way to get some hands-on experience.</p>

    <p>Challenge yourself and learn new concepts. You never really know how good you are at security and computer science until you really try it out. You might just win.</p>

    <p>Don't know anything about computer science or cyber-security? Fear not. IceCTF is designed to accommodate both novice and advanced players alike. Many challenges will guide you to the right resources. As long as you're willing to learn and do a little research, most challenges should be within reach. Check out the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for some tips.</p>

    <h5>Rules</h5>
    <p>We can't really stop you from not obeying the rules. However, infractions <b>will</b> result in disqualification depending on the severity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not share flags with other teams.</li>
      <li>Be fair. Obey the team size limit of 4.</li>
      <li>Duplicate teams composed of the same individuals are not allowed.</li>
      <li>Try to solve problems rather than brute-forcing the submission system. The probability that you will succeed is very small. Seriously.</li>
      <li>Do not DDoS or DoS. Sending continuous requests when a challenge calls for such methods is perfectly acceptable. If you know how to perform these attacks, put your skills to better use by solving the challenges. Don't ruin the fun for everyone.</li>
      <li>Limit the use of automated tools, crawlers, or scanners that send continuous requests over a prolonged period of time. None of these are required to solve any of the challenges.</li>
      <li>Have fun and learn.</li>
    </ul>
